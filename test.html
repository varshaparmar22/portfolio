        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>It involved designing and implementing a robust, serverless data model and automation system using Airtable as the primary database for managing contractor applications. The core goal was to create a structured input flow, automate data management (compression/decompression), implement multi-factor shortlisting rules, and integrate an external Large Language Model (LLM) for automated qualitative application review and enrichment.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Features and Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Structured Data Model (Airtable Schema)
A normalized database schema was established within Airtable, consisting of three linked tables plus two helper tables to capture application details and manage automation5.
•	Applicants (Parent Table): Stores one row per applicant66. Key fields include: Applicant ID (primary), Compressed JSON, Shortlist Status, LLM Summary, LLM Score, and LLM Follow-Ups77.
•	Child Tables (Linked): All child tables are linked back to Applicants by Applicant ID8.
o	Personal Details (One-to-one link to Applicants)99.
o	Work Experience (One-to-many link to Applicants)1010.
o	Salary Preferences (One-to-one link to Applicants)1111.
•	Helper Table: Shortlisted Leads (Auto-populated when shortlisting rules are met)121212.
</li>
<li>
2. User Input and Form Flow
To simulate a multi-table input flow, three separate Airtable forms were used (one per child table)13. Applicants are required to submit all three forms, each pre-filling or asking for the Applicant ID to ensure data linkage14.
</li>
<li>
3. Data Compression and Normalization (Python)
Two critical local Python scripts were developed to manage data efficiency and integrity15:
•	JSON Compression Script: Gathers data from the three linked tables, builds a single JSON object (e.g., storing personal, experience, and salary details), and writes it to the Compressed JSON field16161616.
•	JSON Decompression Script: Reads the Compressed JSON 17and performs an upsert of child-table records to reflect the JSON state 18181818, supporting necessary updates and edits to the normalized data19.
</li>
<li>
4. Automated Lead Shortlisting
An automation system evaluates applicants against defined, multi-factor criteria after the compression step20. If all criteria are met, a record is created in the Shortlisted Leads table21.
•	Criteria:
o	Experience: $\ge 4$ years total OR worked at a Tier-1 company (e.g., Google, Meta, OpenAI)22.
o	Compensation: Preferred Rate $\le \$100$ USD/hour AND Availability $\ge 20$ hrs/week23.
o	Location: In US, Canada, UK, Germany, or India24.
•	Output: Populates the Score Reason field with a human-readable explanation25.
</li>
<li>
5. LLM Evaluation and Enrichment Integration
A robust qualitative review step was implemented by calling an external LLM endpoint26262626.
•	Trigger: After Compressed JSON is written or updated2727.
•	Security: Read API key securely from an Airtable Secret or environment variable (not hard-coded)2828.
•	Prompt Engineering: Feeds the full JSON to the LLM and asks it to perform four specific tasks (Summarize, Rate, Flag Issues, Suggest Follow-ups)29292929.
•	Robustness: Includes validation to log API call failures and implement exponential backoff for up to 3 retries3030.
•	Structured Outputs: Writes to LLM Summary ($\le 75$ words), LLM Score (1-10), and LLM Follow-Ups (bullet list) fields on the Applicants table31313131.
